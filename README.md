<!-- I'm **Felipe Romero** (he/him). I'm a Front-End Software Engineer by passion and an expat by choice living now in Santos/SP, Brazil. I created the [Front-End Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist) in 2017 and have been passionate about open-source since. I'm also an accessibility advocate ([CPACC](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional) certified)! I'm always working on a new project to help the community. -->
